    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Eric. This site is a work in progress, but the intent is to establish an archive for some of the
        <strong>Magic: the Gathering</strong> decks that I have built. Hopefuly navigation is fairly self explanatory, but in the event
        that it's not, the site is broken into sections for various <strong>Magic</strong> game formats. Currently there are only two
        formats available on my site, but in the future I hope to expand this to the various other formats available for
        the game. Each link will provide a brief description of the format, as well as two deck lists per format. Please
        enjoy!</p>
