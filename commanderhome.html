    <h2>WHAT IS COMMANDER?</h2>

    <p>*<em>Commander is an exciting, unique way to play Magic that is all about awesome legendary creatures, big plays,
            and
            battling your friends in epic multiplayer games! In Commander, each player chooses a legendary creature as
            the
            commander of their deck. They then play with a 99-card deck that contains only cards of their commander's
            colors. Also, other than basic lands, each deck can only use one copy of any card. During the game, you can
            cast
            your commander multiple times, meaning your favorite Legendary Creature can come back again and again to
            lead
            the charge as you battle for victory!</em></p>
